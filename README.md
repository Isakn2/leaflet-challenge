# Leaflet Challenge

## Introduction
This project visualizes earthquake data from the last 7 days using The United States Geological Survey (USGS) data feed. The interactive map is built with Leaflet.js and displays earthquake magnitudes, depths, and locations. The map also includes a tectonic plates overlay, providing insight into the relationship between earthquakes and plate boundaries.

## Features
- **Dynamic Earthquake Markers**: Earthquakes are displayed as circle markers with size proportional to their magnitude and color representing their depth.
- **Interactive Popups**: Click on any marker to view detailed information about the earthquake, including its magnitude, depth, and location.
- **Base Layers**: Switch between different base layers such as Satellite, Grayscale, and Outdoors views.
- **Overlay Layers**: Toggle earthquake data and tectonic plates boundaries on the map.
- **Legend**: A legend is included to interpret the depth of the earthquakes based on marker colors.

## Technologies Used
- **Leaflet.js**: For creating the interactive map and managing layers.
- **D3.js**: For fetching and handling GeoJSON data from USGS.
- **GeoJSON**: For visualizing earthquake and tectonic plate data.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building and styling the map interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A web browser to view the map (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- Internet connection to fetch real-time earthquake and tectonic plate data.
